# Object-tracking-algorithms
These are a collection of algorithms which can be efficiently used to track objects in a picture as per user's choice. In the python programs, I have tried to present total 8 ways in which objects in your camera frame can be tracked. These algorithms do not involve any AI/ML knowledge to use so if you're a newbie and not good at them, this is for you !

### Cloning
Use the link below to close this repository to your machine.
```
https://github.com/Severus11/Object-Tracking-Algorithms.git
```
### Pre-requisites 
These are the required dependencies needed to setup the environment
```
$ pip3 install opencv-python==4.3.0
$ pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```
### How to use:
- Install the requirements.txt file and run the desired python file.
- Input the algorithm you want to use for motion tracking.
- An initial frame will pop up. Select the object to be tracked.
- Observe and enjoy moving the object around your screen.
